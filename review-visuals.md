Here’s a tight menu of options—what to use, when, and how to slot it into your app.

Animation libraries (pick by goal)
	•	UI/Micro-interactions (React-first): Motion (Framer Motion successor) – ergonomic props/APIs, layout/exit, scroll; great for buttons, cards, transitions.  ￼
	•	Timeline + path + pro control (framework-agnostic): GSAP – gold-standard timelines, motion paths, SVG/Canvas/WebGL targets, excellent perf.  ￼
	•	Vector art with state machines (designer tool + runtime): Rive – author once in Rive editor, drive via state machine at runtime. Light, fast backgrounds/illustrations/logos.  ￼
	•	Prebuilt JSON animations (AE export): Lottie / dotLottie – huge template ecosystem, lightweight players.  ￼
	•	GPU 2D renderer (for your comet/lines at scale): PixiJS (+ @pixi/react) – WebGL/WebGPU 2D with React bindings. Pair with GSAP for timelines.  ￼
	•	WebGL backgrounds with presets: Vanta.js – drop-in animated backgrounds (fog/cells/waves).  ￼
	•	Particles (config-driven): tsParticles – many presets, React wrapper available.  ￼
	•	Full 3D (only if needed): three.js – for 3D scenes; overkill for your current visuals.  ￼

Templates & assets
	•	Vector animation templates: Rive Community / Marketplace; LottieFiles free/premium packs.  ￼
	•	SVG background generators (static, brandable): Haikei, Hero Patterns, SVGBackgrounds.  ￼
	•	Video loops (if you really want video bg): Coverr & Pexels (free for commercial use—check model/property rights).  ￼
	•	Sound: Howler.js (simple playback, sprites) or Tone.js (procedural pads/heart-like pulses).  ￼

What I’d use for your app (balanced perf/quality)
	1.	Background (monochrome, slow, cheap CPU):
	•	Rive: export a subtle looping background (.riv) and play it at 0.2× speed.
	•	Alternative zero-deps: keep your current SVG with animateTransform (already GPU-friendly).  ￼
	2.	Breath “comet rectangle” (sharp, color-aware):
	•	PixiJS + GSAP: draw the rounded-rect track in Pixi; animate a sprite along the 4 edges via GSAP timeline (seek by phase progress). This keeps 60fps with low CPU and scales better than raw canvas.  ￼
	3.	UI micro-interactions:
	•	Motion (Framer Motion) for cards, buttons, screen transitions—clean React ergonomics.  ￼
	4.	Audio:
	•	Tone.js for soft pink-noise and gentle pulses driven by phase; Howler.js if you decide on sample loops/clicks.  ￼

Tiny integration snippets (minimal)
	•	Rive background (React):

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import riveWASM from '@rive-app/canvas-advanced'; // or canvas
import { Rive, Layout, Fit } from '@rive-app/react-canvas';

export default function Bg() {
  return (
    <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10">
      <Rive src="/bg.riv" animations={['loop']} layout={new Layout({ fit: Fit.Cover })} autoplay />
    </div>
  );
}

(Export your .riv loop from Rive; keep vectors monochrome & low node count.)  ￼

	•	Pixi + GSAP comet (concept):

// Pixi stage once; on phase/progress update, gsap.timeline().progress(p)
// Draw rounded track as Graphics; comet is a Sprite; move by setting x/y along edge.

(GSAP drives a single timeline; you “seek” to phase progress each tick.)  ￼

	•	Motion for UI:

import { motion } from 'motion/react';
<motion.div initial={{opacity:0,y:8}} animate={{opacity:1,y:0}} transition={{duration:0.4}} />

￼

	•	Soft audio (Tone.js):

import * as Tone from 'tone';
const noise = new Tone.Noise("pink").start();
const filt = new Tone.Filter(900, "lowpass").toDestination();
const vol = new Tone.Volume(-32).connect(filt);
noise.connect(vol);
// on phase change: ramp volume/frequency with Tone.Tween/Param.setTargetAtTime

￼

	•	Optional video bg (fallback muted, small file):

<video autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" poster="/bg.jpg"
       class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover -z-10">
  <source src="/bg.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/bg.mp4"  type="video/mp4" />
</video>

(Keep <4–6 MB, 24–30 s seamless loop, opacity 0.15–0.25.)  ￼

Performance & DX tips (quick)
	•	Prefer GPU-friendly props (opacity, transform) and single WebGL context (Pixi). Batch draw; avoid per-frame DOM writes.  ￼
	•	Gate audio start behind a user gesture (browser policy). Use suspend/resume.  ￼
	•	Respect prefers-reduced-motion: swap to static SVG or reduced Pixi ticker.
	•	If you want “no-code” backgrounds fast: Vanta or tsParticles (React wrappers available).  ￼

Decision shortcuts
	•	Want designer-driven vector art with logic → Rive.  ￼
	•	Already happy with React patterns & need simple transitions → Motion.  ￼
	•	Need crisp, scalable custom graphics (your comet/lines) → PixiJS (+ GSAP).  ￼
	•	Need a quick animated bg without coding → Vanta or tsParticles presets.  ￼

If you want, I can draft the wiring for Pixi+GSAP comet and a Rive background drop-in to replace your current components.
